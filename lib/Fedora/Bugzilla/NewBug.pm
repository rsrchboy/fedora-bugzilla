=head1 NAME

Fedora::Bugzilla::NewBug - New bug class


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Fedora::Bugzilla;

    my $bz = Fedora::Bugzilla->new(...);

    # fetch a bug
    my $bug1 = $bz->get_bug('123456');
    my $bug2 = $bz->get_bug('perl-Moose');

    # etc


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a class representing the required elements of a new bug in the 
Bugzilla system.

It can be subclassed to provide default values for different "types" of
classes, e.g. package review bugs are always going to have certain values
defaulted in certain ways.

=head1 INTERFACE

"Release Early, Release Often"

I've tried to get at least the methods I use in here.  I know I'm missing
some, and I bet there are others I don't even know about... I'll try not to,
but I won't guarantee that I won't change the api in some incompatable way.
If you'd like to see something here, please either drop me a line (see AUTHOR) 
or better yet, open a rt ticket with a patch ;)
